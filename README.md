Vitamin CSS
==========

NOTE: Still under early development (Unstable), more Utilities to be added in the near future.

Vitamin CSS is a SASS-Based, BEM, OOCSS boilerplate for building your own extended frameworks. It is meant to be a very minimal starting point for writing organized, scaleable, and object-oriented CSS for large projects.

Once a project is a certain size and has unique design requirments, a pre-styled framework, such as Bootstrap or Foundation, just make things messy and you'll probably find yourself re-writing much of the styling and not using most of the code. Don't get me wrong, these these frameworks are awesome for certain projects, but I personally prefer a cleaner slate on larger projects. This is where Vitamin CSS comes in. It is not pre-styled, rather it provides boilerplate classes and extended style resets, for a cleaner slate, ready to scale into your own custom framework. It also provides a recommended way for structuring your source files, though this is obviously very subjective.

This project has primarily come about for my own use, but if anyone else out there finds it useful, please contribute and help me build this into something rock-solid.

Lastly, I must give credit where it is due, as this project is highly influenced by the work of the following teams and individuals: <a href="https://github.com/csswizardry">Harry Roberts</a>, <a href="https://github.com/necolas">Nicolas Gallagher</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/twbs">Twitter Bootstrap</a>. Definitely have more to credit and will add more later.
